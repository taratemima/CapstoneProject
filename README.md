# CapstoneProject
A repository for my data analysis and data science work. 
I plan to complete projects from Learn Data Analysis with Python, Kaggle, and FreeCodeCamp. I may consider adding the available projects from the data analytics certificate later. I will create a webpage with visualizations and documentation for each project. I plan to adapt the portfolio web page template for this project. I may also examine my natural language technology work and see if I can improve it with more documentation.
